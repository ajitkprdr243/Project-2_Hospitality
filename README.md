Hello everyone,
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data from the hospitality industry to identify key trends, customer behaviors, and business performance indicators. The goal is to help stakeholders make informed decisions to improve hotel occupancy, optimize revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Using tools such as Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, we cleaned and integrated multiple datasets, including booking records, hotel details, and date dimensions. We then developed interactive dashboards to monitor metrics like booking volume, customer demographics, platform usage, and loyalty membership impact.
The insights derived from this analysis will assist in strategic planning for marketing, pricing, and operational improvements across hotel properties.
