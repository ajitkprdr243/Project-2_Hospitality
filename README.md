**Hello everyone**,

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data from the hospitality industry to identify key trends, customer behaviors, and business performance indicators. The goal is to help stakeholders make informed decisions to improve hotel occupancy, optimize revenue, and enhance customer satisfaction.
Using tools such as Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, we cleaned and integrated multiple datasets, including booking records, hotel details, and date dimensions. We then developed interactive dashboards to monitor metrics like booking volume, customer demographics, platform usage, and loyalty membership impact.
The insights derived from this analysis will assist in strategic planning for marketing, pricing, and operational improvements across hotel properties.

**Challenges Faced During Data Cleaning**
- Handling missing values in ratings and cancellation reasons.
- Standardizing inconsistent room category and booking channel entries.
- Merging and aligning fact and dimension tables correctly.
- Addressing duplicate booking IDs and property mismatches.
- Ensuring date formats were uniform across sheets.
- Inconsistent date formats and booking IDs.

**Key Insights**
- High booking volumes observed in luxury hotels in metro cities like Delhi and Mumbai.
- OTA (Online Travel Agents) are the most popular booking channels.
- Younger age groups (18-35) are the most frequent customers. - Direct online bookings yield better loyalty conversion. 
- Peak check-ins during weekends indicate higher leisure travel.

**Conclusion**
- The hospitality data analysis provided clear insights into booking behaviors, customer preferences, and operational performance. Luxury hotels in major cities like Delhi and Mumbai lead in occupancy and revenue, largely driven by online travel agencies and direct online bookings.
- Customer demographics revealed that younger age groups (18â€“35) dominate the booking base, particularly during weekends, indicating a trend toward leisure travel. The data also showed that loyalty members tend to book more frequently and cancel less often, offering higher value to the business.
- Effective data cleaning and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau allowed us to track key metrics in real time, uncovering patterns that are critical for improving customer targeting, pricing strategy, and operational efficiency.
